			<p>My name is Shem Muthanga (the guy on the left looking all cool and whatnot). I like long walks on the beach and love my girlfriend so much. No wait!! That's my fridge. I love my fridge so much. About a week ago, I embarked on an exciting journey to learn computer coding at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/" target="_blank">Moringa School</a>. It's been an intense and gruelling past 5 days but I'm determined to make it to the end. <a href="https://github.com/mesh77" target="_blank">Here</a> are some of the extremely simple projects I've worked on so far. Wish me luck...</p>
